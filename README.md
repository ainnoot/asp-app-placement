## Encodings
The file `encodings/repair.lp` contains the ASP encoding described in the paper. `hide.lp` consists of `clingo` Python APIs scripts to obtain timestamps to reproduce paper plots.

## Instances
Problem instances used in the paper are available at the following [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b_7aZcX7qJwS-NflwNNbqe7Yi1nlhbrR?usp=sharing) (about 3 GB, 30 GB uncompressed). 

The instance generator is available as the Python package `random_network_generator`. To generate instances, please run the `net_gen_script.py` after installing it (`uv pip install -e .`). Generation parameters can be customised in `instances_gen_script.py`.

The filename `i-25_10-058d0164_a03402cb.lp` denotes a problem instance which consists of the deployment of an application of 10 nodes, over an infrastructure of 25 nodes. `058d0164` and `a03402cb` are unique identifiers of an application and an infrastructure/network, as generated by the instance generator.

The `results-selection.zip` contains the analysis for solver selection.
